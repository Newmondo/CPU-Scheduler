The program idispatcher.c is a simulated dispatcher that reads in simulated events through i/o redirection. The simulated events include creating a process (designated with 'C'), exiting a process (designated with 'E'), a process requesting a resource from 1 to 5 (designated with 'R N' where N is the resource number), an interrupt from a resource (designated with 'I N' where N is the resource number), and a timer interrupt (designated with 'T'). Test input files can be found in the test_inputs folder with the corresponded expected output values located in the test_outputs folder.

The program can be compiled using the Makefile with the following command:

make

The program can then be run using a variation of the below command:

./idispatcher<./test_inputs/test0.in

where the "test_inputs/test0.in" can be changed to direct the program to a different input file.
